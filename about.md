### About Me!

*Howdy!* My name is Alex and I'm currently an English masters student at Northeastern University.
My DH Project/MA Thesis is focused on *mushrooms*, or how we describe  these objects and come to understand them through different forms of writing.

### More Information

I **love** eating these mushrooms too. It can't always be about serious academic endeavors.
